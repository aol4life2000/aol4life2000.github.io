<p><span class="header-text">Some Websites</span><br />	
Listed in alphabetical order, but I've highlighted a few I really love with a pink skull.<br />
</p>

<p><a href="http://68k.news">68k.news</a><br />
A great little proxy website for reading news from a variety of sources. Very helpfully includes different sections for different localities. Perfect for use with the text-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_(web_browser)">lynx</a> browser.</p>

<p><a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/">DaveNet</a><br >
Dave Winer has been pretty influential on the world wide web; he made significant contributions to technologies like blogging and podcasting, and seems like an all around great guy. This mini website features a ten-year collection of essays he distributed by email about things that were happening in the tech world between 1994 and 2004.

<p><a href="https://gwern.net">Gwern.net</a><br />
I can't profess to understand all of the things Gwern Branwen talks about. In fact, even some of the most interesting stuff I find on the blog only makes sense to me at a cursory level. Still, it's probably one of the best examples of a fully-realised personal hypertext existence in 2021.

<p><a href="https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/">The History of the Web</a><br />
Well-written articles about the history of the web we all know and try to love.</p>

<p><a href="http://internetarchaeology.org/">Internet Archaeology</a><br />
While it's no longer updated, I thought this was an interesting way to catalogue various excavated web assets from the early world wide web. With so much of our online history constantly crumbling, it's cool to find new ways to keep it alive for a little longer. If you're interested in this kind of thing I highly recommend you check out the below link to the Web Design Museum, too.

<p><a href="http://theoldnet.com">The Old Net</a><br />
A proxy for visiting web pages stored on The Internet Archive. The neat thing is that it strips out all of the scripting added by archive.org, and removes the SSL requirement, so you can use it with just about any old mid-90's computer with a web browser.</p>

<!--skull here-->
<p><a href="http://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a><br />
An online bookmarking and notemaking service. It doesn't do anything flashy, it just works. Worth noting that it only offers a paid service; if you'd like a privacy-first tool to keep track of everything, you can't do much better than Pinboard imo.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.textfiles.com">TextFiles</a><br />
A massive collection of old text files from various BBS networks. Really cool.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/">Web Design Museum</a><br />
One of my absolute favourite websites on the internet: the web design museum. A heroic undertaking, the creators have managed to - somehow - piece together archived layouts from a variety of old websites. All the exhibitions are pretty interesting, but I especially enjoy the Pixel Art section. </p>
